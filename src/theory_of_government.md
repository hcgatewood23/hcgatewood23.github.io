# Thoughts on Theory of Government

## A consensus mechanism

Government is first and foremost a consensus mechanism.

From an evolutionary perspective, [polities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity) rise, struggle, and fall based on their ability to take coordinated actions increasing their chances of survival and reproduction. That is, aside [anthropocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism) biases, polities look much like any other organism, subject to the same [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), pressures, and competitions.

Collective action requires collecting [facts on the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facts_on_the_ground), building consensus on a [course of action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy), then executing that action.

Via the pressures of nature and, especially, competing polities, polities are incentivized to find and implement consensus mechanisms that are both effective and fast. At scale, these often lead to delegation-style decision-making, where a small group of trusted individuals makes decisions on behalf of the whole.

Thus, as the [ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego) mediates the needs of a person's sub-personalities, government mediates the needs of a society's constituent persons — a mechanism for building and guiding executing on consensus.

## The 3 principal functions

From the need to build and execute consensus, 3 principal functions of government emerge:

1. [Monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence)
2. [Maintenance of the economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_regulation)
3. [Provisioning of public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good)

### Monopoly on violence

A monopoly on violence and [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) are equivalent descriptors — that is, a monopoly on violence is both the precursor for sovereignty and a necessary condition for its continuation.

Consider an [anarchic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) "state", with no monopoly on violence. In such a state, individuals must either keep all their possessions with them at all times, or compensate others to guard their possessions in their absense. The winner-take-all nature of violent encounters naturally creates an arms race where individuals prefer to contract protection with the most powerful protection providers, leading to specialization and concentration of power. The natural end-state is a single, powerful protection provider enforcing the peace — in other words, a proto-government engendered and maintained by a monopoly on violence.

Protecting the monopoly and competing against neighboring proto-governments requires, in the same way, a consensus mechanism that is both effective and fast.

### Maintenance of the economy

As a proto-government grows, it finds the need to fund its protection operations. Protection payments (proto-[taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax)) are an effective starting point, but these exacted payments are limited as a function of the polity's aggregate wealth over time — incurring both its caps and risks.

To increase its competitiveness, the proto-government is incentivized to increase and de-risk the aggregate wealth of its constituents. A natural mechanism is maintaining the health of its economy.

A [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) may be a reasonable starting point, but the persisted need for fast, effective consensus means unplanned, [market economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) are often an inevitable evolution against competitive pressures.

Finally, scaled market economies find experienced [financial instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) leads inevitably to [financial regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation), experienced [economic inefficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency) lead to [economic regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_regulation).

### Provisioning of public goods

Finally, at sufficient scale, the incentives of the proto-government and the incentives of its constituents often diverge.

The proto-government seeks to extract value from its constituents to protect itself (preserve and grow its monopoly on violence against natural selection), while its constituents seek to retain their wealth and free will to protect their own individual interests (live, reproduce, and thrive against natural selection).

The proto-government's persons then coordinate to reappropriate a measure of control and self-determination for the individual against the tyranny of the whole — a citizens' union, of sorts.

This reclamation of power for the individual leads in large part to the [redistribution of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth) and continual provisioning and renewal of [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good), 

We can also view provisioning of public goods from a less antagonistic perspective — the proto-government is incentivized to provide *efficiently* for the needs of its constituents to preserve more wealth for protection payments. Thus, the proto-government raises standards of living via investment in shared infrastructure and delegation of common needs to a more efficient subset of specialists (i.e. [public services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service)).

## Applications

Finally, a few applications of these ideas.

### Representative democracy

[Representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) represents an appropriate incorporation of the need for fast, effective consensus in a large polity.

[Non-democratic governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_forms_of_government) can act faster and more effectively in the short term, but lack long-term stability — the small size of the polity's consensus delegation leads to higher variance in their ability to accurately learn the facts on the ground and select an optimal policy.

[Direct democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) may feel more just, but their consensus mechanism is both slow and often ineffective at scale — that is, lack of a specialized consensus delegation results in progressive and eventual loss in platform coherence. For example, a new policy would provide [electricity to every household](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Electrification_Act), at the cost of around 1% of GDP. A standalone bill providing electrification would likely be popular — a standalone bill raising taxes would likely not. In direct democracies, or representative democracies with progressively [weaker parties](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyViG2ar68jkgEi4y6doNZy), the consensus delegation either doesn't exist or [passes the buck to the electorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) (see also: [tyranny of small decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_small_decisions)).

### Market regulation

Equipped now at least a century of observations, it's [challenging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) to argue economies are most efficient under a completely [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market).

Further, from a [pragmatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) perspective, the [lack](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-are-some-examples-free-market-economies.asp) of truly free market economies means market regulation is in practice a necessary function of government.
