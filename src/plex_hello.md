## Onboarding

### üåü Onboarding steps

After creating your accounts with your unique signup link, follow these steps:

1. **Fix Plex**: The one downside to Plex is they make it just a bit difficult to find our server's shared media. So, please go ahead and ‚û°Ô∏è **follow these steps to [fix your homescreen](/plex_homescreen)**.
1. **Save Overseerr**: For easy access, ‚û°Ô∏è **be sure to save [https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io](https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io)** as a website icon on your ***phone's*** Home Screen. [See here for how to do that ‚Äî it's not just a bookmark](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/bookmark-favorite-webpages-iph42ab2f3a7/ios#:~:text=Add%20a%20website%20icon%20to%20your%20Home%20Screen).

### üíï Community guidelines

- **Do not share**: The #1 request I have for you is ‚û°Ô∏è **please don't share your login** info with anyone. I'm happy to make friends their own account! This is the only hard rule.
