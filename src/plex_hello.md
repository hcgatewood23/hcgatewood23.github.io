# Welcome to our media server!

You now have access to [our instance of Plex](https://plex.hcgatewood.io), a private media server. You can think of it like our own personal Netflix.

After onboarding, you'll have access to almost every popular movie.

> NOTE: please do not share your login. I'm happy to make friends their own accounts.

## Onboarding

### üåü Onboarding steps

After creating your Plex+Overseerr accounts with your unique signup link, follow these steps:

1. **Fix Plex**: The one downside to Plex is they make it just a bit difficult to find our server's shared media. So, please go ahead and ‚û°Ô∏è **follow these steps to [fix your homescreen](/plex_homescreen)**.
2. **Save Overseerr**: For easy access, ‚û°Ô∏è **be sure to save [https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io](https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io)** as a website icon on your ***phone's*** Home Screen. [See here for how to do that ‚Äî it's not just a bookmark](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/bookmark-favorite-webpages-iph42ab2f3a7/ios#:~:text=Add%20a%20website%20icon%20to%20your%20Home%20Screen).

### ü¶Ñ About [Overseerr](https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io)

Overseerr is how you **request** new movies and shows.

- **Request media**: Request movies and shows you'd like added. They'll usually take 10 minutes or so to download and become available. By default you'll have a limited number of downloads per week, but don't worry, it refreshes every week.
- **Report issues**: If a movie won't download after 30 minutes, is low quality, or other issue, either message me or use the "Report Issue" button in Overseerr.
