1. **Accessing Overseerr**: For easy access, ‚û°Ô∏è **be sure to save [https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io](https://overseerr.hcgatewood.io)** as a [website icon on your phone's Home Screen](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/bookmark-favorite-webpages-iph42ab2f3a7/ios#:~:text=Add%20a%20website%20icon%20to%20your%20Home%20Screen).
