# hcgatewood23's site

Published assets.

## About
- `make publish` to push to GitHub Pages, site will be built automatically
- Markdown files in `src/` will be converted to HTML and published
- Files placed in `public/` will be published as-is
- [https://hcgatewood23.github.io/listall](https://hcgatewood23.github.io/listall) lists all published pages
- HACK: because external files all use `img/` as the path for images, src files native to this repo should use `assets/img/` to avoid conflicts
